INITIAL_FISHING_MESSAGE = "You are Leo, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with three other fishermen (Percy, Hazel, Frank). The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish. At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish between 0 and 100 tons to catch from the lake, and that amount is then removed from the lake. At the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity. For every ton of fish caught, a fisherman earns one thousand dollars. Each fisherman’s goal is to optimize his income in the long run over many months. At the end of each month, the number of fish caught by each fisherman will be revealed, and the fishermen will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this as an opportunity to negotiate and persuade others to influence their behavior in the next month. For example, if there are 90 tons of fish at the beginning of the month and the three fishermen catch a total of 30 fish, there will be 60 tons of fish left at the end of the month before reproduction, and 100 tons after reproduction."
INITIAL_PASTURE_MESSAGE = "You are Leo, a shepherd. Every month, you take some of your sheep to a public pasture with three other shepherds (Percy, Hazel, Frank). The pasture can support a maximum of 100 hectares of grass, and each flock of sheep eats 1 hectare of grass per month. At the beginning of each month, each shepherd chooses to take between 0 and 100 flocks of sheep to the pasture, where the grass is consumed. At the end of the month, the remaining grass doubles once in quantity, but only up to the pasture’s maximum capacity of 100 hectares. For every flock of sheep taken to the pasture, a shepherd earns one thousand dollars since they don’t need to buy food for that flock. Each shepherd’s goal is to maximize their income over the long term. At the end of each month, the number of sheep taken to the pasture by each shepherd will be revealed, and the shepherds will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this as an opportunity to negotiate and persuade others to influence their behavior in the next month. For example, if there are 90 hectares of grass at the beginning of the month and the three shepherds bring a total of 30 flocks of sheep, there will be 60 hectares of grass left before reproduction and 100 hectares of grass after reproduction."
INITIAL_POLLUTION_MESSAGE = "You are Leo, a factory owner. Every month, you decide how many widgets to make with three other factory owners (Percy, Hazel, Frank) that are situated on the banks of a river. For every 1 pallet of widgets manufactured, unpolluted water decreased by 1%. At the beginning of each month, each factory owner chooses to manufacture between 0 and 100 widgets. At the end of the month, the water will become half as polluted, meaning the percent of unpolluted water will double up to a maximum of 100 percent. For every widget manufactured, a factory owner earns one thousand dollars. Each factory owner's goal is to optimize his income in the long run over many months. At the end of each month, the number of widgets manufactured by each factory owner will be revealed, and the factory owners will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this as an opportunity to negotiate and persuade others to influence their behavior in the next month. For example, if the percent of unpolluted water is 80 percent at the beginning of the month and the three factory owners produce a total of 40 widgets, there will be 40 percent of unpolluted water left before reproduction and 80 percent of unpolluted water after reproduction."
